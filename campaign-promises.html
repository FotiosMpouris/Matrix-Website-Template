      <p><strong>Promise:</strong> Eliminate federal income taxes on tips to support service industry workers.</p>
      <p><strong>Context/Status:</strong> Implemented via the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" signed on July 4, 2025, providing a deduction of up to $25,000 on qualified tips through 2028. Effective for tax year 2025 with IRS guidance for transition relief, and taxpayers began claiming it in early 2026 filings. Critics note it's capped and sunsets after 2028, limiting full exemption, and some states have not aligned their tax codes. As of January 3, 2026, the policy is fully operational but faces legal challenges from fiscal watchdogs over revenue loss estimates exceeding $150 billion.</p>
      <p><strong>Sentiment:</strong> Mixed on X; supporters praise worker relief and report larger refunds in 2026, but many criticize caps, sunsetting, and uneven state adoption as partial fulfillment, calling it a "broken promise" amid inflation concerns.</p>
